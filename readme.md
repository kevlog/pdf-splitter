# PDF Splitter

A simple command-line tool to split PDF files into smaller chunks.

## âœ… Features
- Automatically splits each page of a PDF into its own file
- Processes **all PDF files in a folder**, not just one
- For each PDF, creates a new output folder with the **same name as the file**
- Saves each split page inside the corresponding folder
- Lightweight and easy to use from the command line (CMD)
- No need for external GUI or complex setup

## Example of Hierarki Folder After Running this Tool
```
FOLDER_PDF/
â”œâ”€â”€ file1.pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ file2.pdf
â”œâ”€â”€ file1/
